Photo Sharing - https://photo-sharing-example.herokuapp.com/

A social sharing site where users can publish and view other pictures in their network. To get started, create an account and upload your pictures to your private profile. When you’re ready, publish your pictures to the homepage – where other users can like them and visit your public profile. 

Photo Sharing is built on the Meteor framework which powers user authentication and MongoDB queries. The entire front end is built with React - including the React-Dropzone npm package for image uploads. Images are stored in the cloud storage application Cloudinary and their urls are saved in their MongoDB documents.
